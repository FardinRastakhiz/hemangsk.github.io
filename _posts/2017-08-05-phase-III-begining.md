Hey There! Hope you're doing great.

So we are in final phase of GSoC and I've finished several things till now. Firstly I modified the coala-html CSS to use coalaCSS and styled the navigation accordingly. It now used tabbed navigation which is consistent with coala websites.
There are now card views for results and files. Diffs are shown in result tab as well.

The next important thing was to implement an omni search power, which should be powerful enough to search either file, bear or severity and filter the correct search results. So now its a lot more easy to conduct searches in the results tab.

The coming week will be mostly about documentation and bug fixing.

I'll keep updating the blog.
