Hello Everyone!

We've reached the end of PHASE I and we've been able to get lot of stuff done. First things first, please checkout
and run coala Online now on coala.io :tada: :tada: 



![screencapture-localhost-8080-1498470143356](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13018570/27540215-06ac9ce8-5a9d-11e7-9b2a-e595f9947ac1.png)



How was it! There are some issues with it right now, it'd be really cool if you can file them at 
https://github.com/coala/landing-frontend/issues, that's the repository for all the coala Online issues. 

The first phase experience was absolutely exciting, 
- During the first week we worked on modifications in coala-quickstart required to obtain
a coafile with bears having non optional settings.
- In second week, I created a docker image. This was my first experience with Docker, it was a bit challenging inititally 
because of low RAM on my laptop as docker
ate a lot of memory. At one point, I used to type a key and it appeared like 5 second later on terminal. :joy: The other challenge was 
this whole concept of
using containers, workers and load balancing, and I had to get the right mindset for it. Because things go wrong on production server, it
a serious issue. Live users are using a piece of software and we have to be sure that we know what we are doing. 
- Finale, In this week I made the user interface for coala Online. This work is like deep sea diving, you jump in and start wandering and exploring,
expect to see a regular catfish, until a beautiful nemo passes by, and you end up partying with it. 
Okay weird analogy. 

Its like you start create something, and then a find about a weird css trick that end up making stuff awesome, that's the fun part!

Thanks to Lasse and Fabian for being there! It's an incredible, really incredible experience.

That's all folks!
